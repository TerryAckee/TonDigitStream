## 🎙️ Logic Walkthrough --[-AUDIO ON]-- for narration
> This video provides a narrated breakdown of the active logic changes to demonstrate the engineering intent behind the implementation.



TimeStamps! 2m19s
I showcase my procedural understanding and efficiency
carrying out necessary operations through accessing code already written
and adjusting it to the --[ required or requested need]-- in the secure steps without any stops in the running system!
Here I am showing my understanding does not limit the outcomes and results I can produce and create using code that is already 
built by showing my high logical understanding and practical experience in practical example
by explaining an AI assitant's code structure, the orgnization of it what line deals produces 
each particular result, the variables and the direct components they each access or adjust [increase, decrease, multiply, raise, store a value, organize an array]


Minutes 3-8 
While attempting to get the result I displayed I could produce through my understanding of language logic 
and experience on the first try,   - I made [adjustments] to the code. [Programming in values attempting
to produce the final result I got at 8m59s or 9m to be short!]


8m59s
I acted on the decision to re-adjust a series of many small changes I had made
before demonstrating my understanding of a native code and script's logic and ability to adjust it
to produce results that I want because of my understanding of logic and practical experience!
[ Here I am showing orginization and the holding the value of tracibility of actions and adjustments to the code.
noting each of the adjustments I made, then changing them all back to what they were before. Removing room for any unnaccounted mistakes! 
[Tracability]
---[Concepet of not changing anyhing other than what needs to be changed and making note of every single adjustment that I make so that they can all be traced back 
in the case of using them to track a mistake in the process.]

A minimalist C animation using `ncurses` and trigonometric functions to create a "floating whisp" effect in the terminal.

![Project Demo](path/to/your/demo.gif)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** C
- **Libraries:** `ncurses` (Terminal UI), `math.h` (Trigonometry)
- **Concepts:** Polar-to-Cartesian mapping, double buffering, real-time input handling.

## 🚀 How to Run
To run this on a Linux/Unix system, ensure you have the `ncurses` development library installed.

```bash
# Compile
gcc src/Tstoc.c -o Tstoc -lncurses -lm

# Run
./Tstoc

🧠 The Logic
The animation uses sine and cosine to calculate a circular path, combined with a horizontal drift. To maintain a "clean" visual field without ghosting, the program utilizes a hard-clear refresh cycle and tethered mathematical offsets for the trailing "whisp" digits.

### 4. The GitHub Commands
Once your files are ready in your local folder, run these in your terminal:

1.  **Initialize:** `git init`
2.  **Add Files:** `git add .`
3.  **Commit:** `git commit -m "Initial commit: Zen Digit Stream with tethered whisp effect"`
4.  **Connect:** `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Zen-Digit-Stream.git`
5.  **Push:** `git push -u origin main`



### Why this works for a portfolio:
It shows you aren't just writing "Hello World"—it proves you can handle **memory-safe UI updates**, **external library linking**, and **real-time loops**.
