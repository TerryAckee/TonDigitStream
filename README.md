🛠 Practical Resiliency Showcase: Live Logic Repair
"How I solve the unknown in real-time."

The Scenario: First-time exposure to a native AI assistant script structure.

The Goal: Perform a live "hot-fix" on logic errors and variable organization without interrupting the running system.

The Result: Full system restoration and logic optimization in under 13 minutes.

In this segment I -       [properly identified and adjusted the AI generated program script's properties

to take the curve out of the coordinates programmed to set the path of my variable by editing those functions in the script]
but

because I am totally new to .c and it's command langauge purpose and functions - [I didn't manage to

set the movement of the coordinates back to the right on the first try [+ coordinates].

 "The Challenge: First-time exposure to a native AI assistant script. Objective: Identify and repair logic errors in a live running system without downtime."




[02:19] - Zero-Day Analysis: Initial exposure to the logic structure. Demonstrating the ability to read and interpret "foreign" code variables and array organizations on the fly.





[05:40] - Logic Adjustment: Real-time modification of variables (increase, multiply, store) to align the script with requested needs.




[10:15] - System Verification: Proving that the "Practical Experience" translates to a stable, running result with no system stops.

[ Here I am showing orginization and the holding the value of tracibility of actions and adjustments to the code.
noting each of the adjustments I made, then changing them all back to what they were before. Removing room for any unnaccounted mistakes! 
Key Takeaway: While others may struggle for months with critical logic failures, this recording proves my ability to analyze, adapt, and deploy solutions in a high-pressure, first-exposure environment.

A minimalist C animation using `ncurses` and trigonometric functions to create a "floating whisp" effect in the terminal.

![Project Demo](path/to/your/demo.gif)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** C
- **Libraries:** `ncurses` (Terminal UI), `math.h` (Trigonometry)
- **Concepts:** Polar-to-Cartesian mapping, double buffering, real-time input handling.

## 🚀 How to Run
To run this on a Linux/Unix system, ensure you have the `ncurses` development library installed.

```bash
# Compile
gcc src/Tstoc.c -o Tstoc -lncurses -lm

# Run
./Tstoc

🧠 The Logic
The animation uses sine and cosine to calculate a circular path, combined with a horizontal drift. To maintain a "clean" visual field without ghosting, the program utilizes a hard-clear refresh cycle and tethered mathematical offsets for the trailing "whisp" digits.

### 4. The GitHub Commands
Once your files are ready in your local folder, run these in your terminal:

1.  **Initialize:** `git init`
2.  **Add Files:** `git add .`
3.  **Commit:** `git commit -m "Initial commit: Zen Digit Stream with tethered whisp effect"`
4.  **Connect:** `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Zen-Digit-Stream.git`
5.  **Push:** `git push -u origin main`



### Why this works for a portfolio:
It shows you aren't just writing "Hello World"—it proves you can handle **memory-safe UI updates**, **external library linking**, and **real-time loops**.
